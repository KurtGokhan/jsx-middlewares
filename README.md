# React Overhaul

A simple mechanism to add custom logic to JSX elements by injecting your own overhaul.

## Commands

- `yarn start` - Start development server
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint
- `yarn test` - Run Jest (alternatively `yarn test:watch`)
- `yarn prettier` - Run Prettier (alternatively `yarn prettier:fix`)

## Contributing guidelines

- Use VSCode when possible. This will ensure that documents are formatted properly (with Prettier) and you will be warned about lint errors (with ESLint).
- Install recommended VSCode extensions.
- All of lint, test and prettier steps must pass in order to be able to release.

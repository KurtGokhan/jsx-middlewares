## Contributing guidelines

- Use VSCode when possible. This will ensure that documents are formatted properly (with Prettier).
- Install recommended VSCode extensions.
- `build`, `test` and `prettier` commands must pass in order to be able to release.

## Commands

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run Jest (alternatively `npm run test:watch`)
- `npm run check` - Run lint

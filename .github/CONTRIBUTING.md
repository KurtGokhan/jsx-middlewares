## Contributing guidelines

- Use VSCode when possible. This will ensure that documents are formatted properly (with Prettier).
- Install recommended VSCode extensions.
- `build`, `test` and `prettier` commands must pass in order to be able to release.

## Commands

- `yarn start` - Start development server
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn test` - Run Jest (alternatively `yarn test:watch`)
- `yarn prettier` - Run Prettier (alternatively `yarn prettier:fix`)
